Repository storing code written during final year MSci project, "Electric Fields in Controlled Freezing". 

## Current Task:
Investigate pertubations to water molecules in 1H ice under influence of (weak) external electric field. 

### To be Implemented:

- ~~Generate single hexagonal tile, where vertices represent locations of water molecules.~~
- ~~Have method for generating tessellating structures.~~
- Have tiles know when their vertices intercept (this will avoid placing multiple molecules at each vertex).
- Add a dipole at each vertex in the lattice.
- Know where dipoles point in 1H ice.
- Include strength of dipole interactions.
- Include effect of weak electric field.
- Measure resulting polarizations and rotational perturbations.
